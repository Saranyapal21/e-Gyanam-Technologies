Hero !  Best of Monkeys! It is because of my recent importunities that thou wilt not now speak to me I Rise,  Lion among Monkeys and rest on a comfortable couch ! Those great monarchs, thine equals, do not sleep on the earth; or is the earth thy cherished love, since even in dying thou dost lie by her and scornest me?\" Without doubt,  Warrior, thanks to thy great exploits, thou hast founded another and more glorious Kishkindha in heaven ! The pleasures we once shared in the woods and in the fragrant bowers are henceforth at an end. I am bereft of all joy and hope and sunk in a sea of sorrow, since thou, tbe King of Kings. art returning to the five elements. My heart must be made of stone, since, seeing thee lying on the earth, grief does not cause it to break into a thousand pieces. Thou didst steal away Sugrivas consort and sent him into exile; it is tbe fruit of this double fault that thou art now expiating,  Chief of the Monkeys !\" Intent on thy welfare, I submitted to thy senseless re-proaches; I, who in the desire to be of service to thee gave thee nought but wise counsel,  Indra of Monkeys I Now,  Proud Lord, beguiled by their youthful and seductive beauty, thou art moving the hearts of tbe Apsaras. It is irrevocable fate which this day has put an end to thine existence; thou whom Sugriva could not vanquish hast resigned thyself to its power I  The body being aaid to rejoin the elements at death.

Beholding Rama wrought up with extreme ire and those fearful portents, all beings were filled with fear and Ravena too felt dismayed. The Gods in their chariots, the Gandharvas, the great Serpents, the Rishis, the Danavas, Daityas and winged creatures of the air gazed down on that conflict between those two warriors, who fought with every kind of dreadful weapon, so that it appeared like the dissolution of the worlds. Suras and Asuras who had come to witness the struggle, with their eyes followed that formidable duel, uttering words of sympathy and encouragement and the assembled Asuras cried out to Dasha-griva Victory to Thee ! and the Suras addressing Rams reiterated Triumph !Triumph ! At that instant the wicked Ravena, in his fury against Rama whom he wished to slay, took hold of an immense weapon that was as hard as diamond, deafening, the destroyer of its foe, furnished with spikes like unto mountain peaks, dreadful to conceive or behold, and Ravana lifted up that lance with its smoke-wreathed flaming point, like unto the fires at the time of the final dissolution of the worlds, that was greatly to be feared, irresistible and which death itself could not endure, the terror of all beings, whom it was able to crush to fragments. At the height of anger, he raised his Strong arm and, surrounded by his brave ttoops, brandishing his weapon, that colossus, his eyes red with fury, emitted a piercing cry in order to encourage his forces, and earth, sky and the four quaners trembled at that fearful shout of the King of the Titans. With his stout arm, taking hold of that weapon he emitted a great cry and addressed his opponent insolently in these words :-\" This spear, as strong as a diamond, Rama, that I wield in my wrath, through my prowess will shortly rob thee and thy brother of your lives !Thou shalt share the fate of my brave soldiers whom thou didst massacre in the forefront of the battle.\n",
